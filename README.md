<Code Refactoring for Horiseon website>
## Description
Hello! This is a code refactoring project to increase accessibility for the Horiseon website.

This project was undertaken for a multitude of reasons:
- Accessibility is an important factor in web design, both for the user and coders behind a given project.
- If an when changes need to be made, to improve functionality, the code should be ordered and written in a logical fashion, to eliminate guesswork and headaches from future changes.
- All header links will now properly navigate to their respective sections on the site!

Below is a screenshot of how the website should look at a glance.
